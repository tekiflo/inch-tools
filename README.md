# Claude Agent Configuration

## Important Instructions
- **SHOULD**: Use TypeScript over JavaScript whenever possible.
- **MUST**: Correct me if I'm wrong.
- **MUST**: If code has been written, commit after each prompt completion using conventional commits format (no description, only one-line title)
- Never use null values unless I explicitly say so or if it's absolutely needed

## Context Usage
- Use context7 for specific tasks and reference

## Code Style
- Avoid comments unless the code is extremely complex

```

## MCP Servers
- **context7**: Documentation and code examples for libraries
- **code-reasoning**: Structured reasoning and problem solving
